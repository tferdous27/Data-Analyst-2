# Wrangle and Analyze Data
Data wrangling is a process where data is gathered from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed for quality and tidiness, and cleaned. Data wrangling prepares a dataset to perform analyses on and showcase visualizations of the findings.

The goal of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It has a unique rating system, which is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.

WeRateDogs Twitter data is a large file. Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time. Therefore, this project requires to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues. Python and its libraries are used to perform data wrangling, analyses, and visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook.
